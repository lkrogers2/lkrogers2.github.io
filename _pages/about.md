I am an assistant professor in the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy at the University of Utah. My research focuses on how policies and organizational conditions influence the career outcomes of K-12 district leaders, principals, and teachers. 

I am passionate about helping education leaders to be data literate consumers of research.
